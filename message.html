    <h1>Kimberly Joy, my asawa hereâ€™s my heartfelt message...</h1>

    <p>Happy 18th birthday, Kimberly Joy, asawa ko, favorite girl, my future wife, and my BFF premium. ðŸ’–
    I wish you good health, more birthdays to come, success in your studies, and a long, happy, and meaningful life ahead. You truly deserve the best on your special day. ðŸŒ·</p>

    <p>I wanted to do something that felt real, not just another greeting or simple message. You deserve something made with effort, something that shows how much thought Iâ€™ve put into it.<br>
    I may not always say what I feel directly, but through this, I hope you see how much you mean to me.</p>

    <p>I know things werenâ€™t always clear between us. You once said you might seem paasa or worried about how others might see it.<br>
    But honestly, I never saw you that way. I understood, maybe not everything, but enough to know you were just trying to protect your heart.</p>

    <p>And I know nga indi ka pa ready for a relationship, but thatâ€™s okay. Iâ€™m willing to wait until the time comes nga ready ka na.<br>
    Iâ€™ll always be right here beside you, willing to support you, teach you in programming and computing, and be your sandigan, kakampi, number one supporter, and photographer.<br>
    Gya lang ko always, in case you forget that someoneâ€™s quietly cheering for you. ðŸ’«</p>

    <p>I also remember you said nga gusto mo gid makabawi sa family mo, especially kay tatay mo, kay mama mo, kay tita kag tito mo, kag sa lola mo.<br>
    You said you wanted to return the favor for all their sacrifices once you graduate, and I admire you for that.<br>
    It shows how selfless and strong your heart truly is, that behind your smiles, thereâ€™s someone doing her best not just for herself, but for the people she loves.<br><br>
    And I want you to know, Iâ€™ll help you achieve that goal. Iâ€™ll be there to support you while you chase your dreams and reach the point nga makabawi ka gid sa ila, because I believe in you and in everything you can do. ðŸŒ»</p>

    <p>I just want you to know that my intentions are genuine and pure.<br>
    Also, hambal mo kaina nga may deja vu ka daw, kay daw na-experience mo na nga una ko friend ang best friend mo, tapos ikaw gali ang nahulog-an ko. Hahaha.<br>
    Pero to tell you the truth, waay ko man ginamit si Jannah para maging close kita.<br>
    The thing is, imaw permi ni Jannah iya ex, tapos kita ang permi imaway, amo siguro nga naging close kita. ðŸ˜…</p>

    <p>I wonâ€™t lie, there were moments of quiet disappointment, times when I hoped for something more, and it didnâ€™t happen.<br>
    But I donâ€™t care about the money, time, or effort I give. Way nako labot da, as long as I make you smile.<br>
    Even if thereâ€™s a chance indi ma-paid off dan, at least I showed this side of me. I gave the best effort I could give.<br><br>
    Because every bit of it, the late nights, the ideas, and the time spent thinking of ways to make you smile, all came from something real.</p>

    <p>Youâ€™ve inspired me in ways you probably donâ€™t even know.<br>
    So today, I just want to thank you for being someone who made me feel something genuine. You deserve every bit of happiness, not just today, but always. ðŸŒ¸</p>
    <p>I will also want to treat you better than your past, and e prove ko simo nga nd tanan nga laki sa una lng mayad</p>

    <p>Made with effort, understanding, and a heart that still believes youâ€™re worth it. ðŸ’ž</p>
    <p>So enjoy your day, Kimberly. ðŸŽ‚</p>
